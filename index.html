		<h1>Access to Big Data in Bioinformatics</h1>
		<h2>Project description</h2>
		<p>
		Collaboration between bioinformatics organizations involves shared access to large
		datasets. This project investigates two avenues for tackling the collaborative analysis
		of big data in bioinformatics: Efficient transport of large datasets across high speed
		WAN networks and implementation of community clouds that host and securely execute
		code close to the location where data is stored.<br>
		Historically, data has been exchanged using tools and protocols like SSH and FTP,
		but new protocols, such as GridFTP [Allcock et al. 2005] and HPN-SSH [Rapier and
		Bennett 2008], offer more efficient use of high speed networks.<br>
		Community clouds [Briscoe and Marinos 2009] are cloud computing services built on
		micro clouds hosted by collaborating organisations, as opposed to conventional cloud
		computing hosted by cloud vendors (such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon) [Jadeja
		and Modi 2012]. Hosting micro clouds close to scientific data collections would facilitate
		scientific collaboration through moving code closer to data, rather than vice versa.
