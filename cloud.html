						<h2>Micro Cloud</h2>
						<p>Allow users to process Big data in a configurable environment. This can be remote, and all processing is done where the data is stored. </p>
					</header>
					
					<div>
						<p>Cloud infrastructure is the combination of multiple compute
						and storage resources presented as a single system on
						the internet. Cloud computing has developed considerably
						over the last decade. Examples of commercial cloud offerings
						include Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine.
						 Cloud infrastructure has the potential to simplify
						the processing of big data sets, as well as collaboration between
						remote researchers.
						</p>
						<p>
						The traditional approach to creating a cloud platform allows
						users to run their own instances of operating systems
						(such as Amazon EC2) via virtualisation technology. This
						includes both hardware level emulation support and the software
						needed to manage the virtualisation. These virtualisation
						schemes use machine level virtualisation. Other
						commercial cloud platforms exist besides Amazon EC2, including
						Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Digital
						Ocean.</p>
						<p>
						A new method, known as containerization, provides much
						of the same functionality, with added benefits of lower resource
						usage and better performance. Containers are able to
						run native machine instructions whereas virtualisation emulates
						every machine instruction. Containers are only
						useful when complete virtualisation is not needed, but allow
						for isolated application deployment and portability. The use
						of containers instead of virtual machines has only recently
						become popular with the release of Docker. The growth
						in popularity has resulted in a number of systems being developed
						including Rancher and Kubernetes.
						</p>
						<p>
						
						<b>Docker</b> is an implementation of a Linux container management
						tool. Docker functions similarly to virtualisation.
						It uses an image to quickly launch a pre-configured isolated
						environment. The key difference is that containers directly
						use the Linux kernel on the host machine to run native instructions,
						whereas virtual machines emulate the entire operating
						system, including the kernel. Every virtual machine
						launches its own kernel and is not aware of the host kernel.
						This key difference make containers lightweight, allowing
						them to be launched in a fraction of time compared to
						launching a virtual machine.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Kubernetes</b> is a pure container manager specifically designed
						to orchestrate Docker containers. Kubernetes version
						1 has recently been released. Kubernetes is easy to use and
						not cluttered and aims to solve a single problem of being a
						container manager.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Ceph</b> storage is a distributed object storage system. Ceph
						provides flexibility and implements abstractions to use Ceph
						objects as block storage or as a network file system, in addi-tion to using plain Ceph objects. Ceph objects are based
						on RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store).
						Ceph provides scalability and reliability through automatic
						distribution and replication of objects.
						</p>

						<p>
						We aim to demonstrate a proof-of-concept micro cloud platform
						that provides users with a configurable environment,
						taking advantage of open source cloud software and Docker
						containers to enable efficient processing of Big Data. The
						aim is to build a micro cloud platform, using Docker as the
						main technology, and form a community cloud which allows
						sharing of data and collaboration of users between multiple
						micro clouds. Users can access data and submit jobs to the
						micro cloud by interacting with a front end web interface.

						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>
						The implemented micro cloud platform enables a user to
						submit a job, which it then automatically builds and schedules
						onto a worker node. Once the job is complete it allows
						the user to download the results. The user is able to view
						the job queue and the status of each job.
